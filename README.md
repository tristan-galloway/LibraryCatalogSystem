# Overview

I am currently learning a lot coding. My goal with this and the other projects I'm working on is to expand my expertise in multiple languages.
This project will show my ability to use encapsulation and modularization in c#.
This library managment system will allow me to have classes for the books and library.
Users can select the book they'd like to borrow by number and return books by their title.

# Future Work

- Search function needs more user proofing. Right now it will just return a book if it finds the string present. If the user were to type "the" it would return every book with the word "the" in the title.
- Design a functioning deticated UI.
- Importing and exporting functionality still needs built.
- Add more error catching for user inputs.
- Switch book availablity from a bool to a int for the number of versions the library has of the given book.
- Add loading symbol and clear the terminal more often in between activities
