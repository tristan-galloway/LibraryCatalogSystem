# Overview

I am currently learning a lot coding. My goal with this and the other projects I'm working on is to expand my expertise in multiple languages.
This project will show my ability to use encapsulation and modularization.
This library managment system will allow me to have classes for the books and library, as well as import and export the library data using file.
